# No TypeScript files in directory `/app/`

From the documentation of the add-on `ember-cli-typescript`:
https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/blob/4e4b161d55aae9d3409f7b7ad9630473af87109b/docs/ts/with-addons.md

> Because addons have no control over how files in `app/` are transpiled, you cannot have `.ts` 
> files in your addon's `app/` folder.
